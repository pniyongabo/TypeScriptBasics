# TypeScript Basics

Most of the examples here will assume that you have TypeScript installed.
You can install TypeScript as a node module using npm:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

To compile each example, `cd` into the directory and use the `tsc` command to compile.
`tsc` will use each directory's `tsconfig.json` to get specific compiler options.
